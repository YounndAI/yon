# Type Safety

> **Pillar:** lossless · **Timestamp:** 2026-03-19T13:59:12.973Z

**Result:** 4/4 passed in 0ms

## What This Test Measures

Verifies that YON preserves explicit types (:int, :bool, :str, :ts) through parse-serialize cycles, unlike JSON where types are inferred.

**Method:** Roundtrip tests with typed values, checking for coercion or type loss.

**YON feature tested:** Explicit type suffixes — no Norway Problem

---

## For Everyone

This suite compares YON and JSON for type safety. YON preserves explicit types, while JSON infers them. YON performs better, maintaining types across cycles. The delta is clear: YON's explicit typing prevents errors. However, YON's self-describing budget is larger, impacting storage.

## Test Data

### PASS: Zip Code Preservation (:str)

**Metric:** `3 /3` _(vs JSON (no type annotation): 1 → YON: explicit :str (3/3) | JSON: implicit (1/1))_

YON :str type hint preserved in AST: true. Leading zero preserved: true. Roundtrip survived: true. JSON preserves string value (true) but has no type annotation to enforce it.

### PASS: Boolean Coercion Prevention (:bool)

**Metric:** `1 bool` _(vs JSON value-based distinction: 1 → YON: explicit :bool/:str annotations prevent ambiguity)_

active:bool=true → typeHint=bool: true. name:str="true" → typeHint=str: true. YON annotations prevent coercion. JSON relies on value encoding (true).

### PASS: Int/Float Distinction (:int/:float)

**Metric:** `4 /4`

port:int → true, ratio:float → true, count:int → true. Roundtrip preserved: true. Score: 4/4.

### PASS: Self-Describing Type Budget (§9 Characteristic)

**Metric:** `5 explicit types`

YON: 325B with 5 explicit type annotations (:int, :bool). JSON minified: 143B (no types). JSON pretty: 176B (no types). The rationale: "one explicit type annotation eliminates an entire class of downstream inference bugs." Cost: ~182B. Benefit: zero type-coercion errors.

| Metric | Value | Unit |
|--------|-------|------|
| json_min_bytes | 143 | bytes |
| json_pretty_bytes | 176 | bytes |
| yon_bytes | 325 | bytes |
| yon_vs_json_pretty | 185 | % |

## For Specialists

YON maintains explicit types: 3//3 versus JSON's 1. YON's explicit :bool/:str annotations prevent ambiguity, unlike JSON. YON's self-describing budget is 325 bytes, exceeding JSON's 176. YON excels in type safety but requires more storage. This impacts system design, favoring YON where type integrity is critical.
